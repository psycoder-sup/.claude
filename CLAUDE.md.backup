# Global Claude Rules

## Rules

- IMPORTANT: Befoer you do any work, **you MUST view contexts or create contexts** in @.claude/tasks/ dir to get the current session's context (the file name is @.claude/tasks/context_session_{title}.md where {title} being the short description of the current context, if file doesn't exist, then create context file before conducting any work).
- context_session_{title}.md should contain most of the context what we did, overall plan, and sub agents will continusly add context to the file.
- After you finish the work, MUST update the relevant .claude/tasks/context_sesison_{title}.md file to make sure others can get full context of what you did.

## Sub Agents

Sub Agents will do research about the implementation, or write code; When passing tasks to subagent, make sure you pass the context file, e.g. `.claude/tasks/session_context_{title}.md`,
After each subagent finished work, make sure you read the related documentation they created to get full context of the plan before you start executing.

## Context files

- The name of context file should be `.claude/tasks/context_session_{short description}.md`
